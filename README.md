# iata-datathon

Document Purpose: 
This document outlines a detailed, strategic plan to win the IEU Sustainability Datathon. It defines our roles, methodologies, timeline, and key deliverables, with a focus on exceeding the evaluation criteria.

Our Winning Philosophy: 
We will win by combining impeccable technical execution with deep strategic insight. Our work will not only answer the questions asked but will also provide a compelling, evidence-based vision for the future of sustainable aviation in Europe. We will meticulously address every point in the technical (T1-T5) and business (B1-B3) evaluation criteria.

Key Roles:
- Project Lead
- Data Lead
- Economic & Policy Lead

Phase 1: Foundation & Mentorship Prep (Nov 3rd - Nov 7th)
Objective: To establish our project infrastructure and core strategy immediately, and to prepare targeted questions for our first mentorship session. This phase is critical and must be executed with urgency.

By Nov 4th:
- Deconstruct the Criteria: As a team, review the Evaluation Criteria. In our shared drive, create a document mapping our planned actions to each criterion.
- Initial Data Sweep: Identify and download key datasets from IATA, Eurostat, EEA, and other credible sources. Log every source in a shared bibliography.
- Hypothesis Workshop: Hold a 1-hour team meeting to define our initial hypotheses for all three objectives.

By Nov 6th:
- Prepare for Mentorship 1: Based on our initial data sweep and hypotheses, formulate a list of specific, intelligent questions for our mentor. Do not ask questions we can answer ourselves. Focus on their industry expertise. Examples:
"We are considering modeling SAF price elasticity based on historical oil shocks. Do you think this is a valid assumption for the nascent SAF market?"
"Beyond feedstock, what does IATA consider the single biggest non-financial barrier to SAF adoption in the next 5 years?"


Nov 3rd - 7th:
- Attend Mentorship 1: Execute the first mentorship session. Someone must write up the minutes from the meeting is recorded.
- Review EDA Workshop for guidance.

Phase 1 Deliverable: A fully configured collaboration suite, a prioritized list of data sources, and a clear set of strategic questions validated by our mentor.

Phase 2: Deep Dive - Modeling, Analysis & Storytelling (Nov 8th - Nov 21st)
Objective: To execute the core technical and business analysis in parallel, going beyond the baseline requirements to build our winning edge.

Technical Modeling:
- Complete a thorough EDA of all datasets. Document findings in the Colab notebook.
- Baseline Model: Build the core model to calculate the four required metrics for scenarios S0 and S1. Ensure the output format is perfect (T4).
- Enhancement 1 - Dynamic Demand: Build a regression model linking jet fuel demand to EU GDP forecasts to create a more robust demand projection.
- Enhancement 2 - Differentiated SAF: Model a mix of SAF types (e.g., HEFA, e-fuels) with varying emission reduction potentials over the 2025-2050 timeline.


Economic & Policy Analysis:
- Cost-Benefit Model: Develop a model showing the total cost of ownership (fuel + carbon cost) for airlines under S0 and S1.
- Barrier Analysis: Use PESTLE to structure the analysis of barriers to SAF adoption.
- Policy Simulation (S2 Scenario): Model our proposed third scenario, "S2: The Smart Incentive Pathway," demonstrating how a policy like CFD could close the economic gap.


Storytelling & Narrative:
- Attend Storytelling Through Data Workshop (Nov 12th): Absorb all lessons and apply them to our project.
- Draft Executive Summary Outline: Create the structure based on the Pyramid Principle. As the analysts produce charts and insights, begin slotting them into the narrative.


Nov 17th - 21st:
Prepare for and Attend Mentorship 2: This session should be used to validate our work beyond the scope of their expectations. Present our S2 scenario and its findings to the mentor for feedback and critique.


Phase 2 Deliverable: A functioning and reproducible analytical model, a comprehensive economic and policy analysis, and a drafted outline of the executive summary and presentation.

Phase 3: Polish & Submission (Nov 22nd - Nov 28th)
Objective: To synthesize our analysis into a flawless, compelling, and persuasive final submission package.

Internal Deadline - Nov 26th: All analysis, modeling, and writing must be complete. The remaining time is for polish, practice, and review.
The Executive Summary:
- Write the full 3-5 page report, focusing on powerful, data-backed conclusions.
- Ensure all assumptions and sources are explicitly and logically connected to the outcomes (B1).


The Final Presentation (Lead Storyteller):
- Create the 5-minute, visually-driven slide deck.
- Schedule at least three full-team practice sessions, including a Shark Tank Q&A simulation where the team asks the toughest questions possible.


.ipynb Submission:
- Code Freeze & Review (Nov 27th): No more changes to the code. Conduct a final peer review for clarity, comments, and efficiency (T5).
- Reproducibility Test: Have a team member run the entire notebook from a clean environment. If it produces a single error, it fails the test and must be fixed.
- Prepare Submission Package (Nov 27th): Project Lead to gather the final Notebook, Output File, and Executive Report.

Final Submission - Nov 28th @ 12pm:
We submit the night before the deadline.

Phase 3 Deliverable: A winning pitch deck ready for the closing ceremony on December 5th.
